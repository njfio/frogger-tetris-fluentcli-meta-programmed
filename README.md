# Tetris Frogger!

## Description

Get ready for a ribbiting twist on two classic arcade games! Tetris Frogger mashes up the falling block puzzle action of Tetris with the perilous road-crossing challenge of Frogger. 

**In Tetris Frogger:**

* **Tetrominoes fall from the sky, Tetris-style.**
* **Instead of clearing lines, you guide your frog across the screen to reach home.**
* **The falling blocks become obstacles and platforms.**
* **Cars, logs, and other hazards from Frogger add to the challenge.**

Can you navigate your frog through the cascading chaos and guide him to safety?
